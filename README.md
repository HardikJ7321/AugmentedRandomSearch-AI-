# AugmentedRandomSearch-AI-
This repository contains the practical implementation of Augmented Random Search which is an artificial intelligence algorithm published in
the research paper by Horia Mania, Aurelia Guy and Benjamin Recht in March 2018. The complete research paper is available at the url : https://arxiv.org/pdf/1803.07055.pdf)          
The jupyter notebook contains the whole python implementation of the ARS algorithm used for training the AI to walk in the Half Cheetah 
environment provided by the gym library by OpenAI
The abstract of algorithm is that it basically uses shallow learning and uses the method of finite differences to update the weights.
I was able to get a reward of approx. 900 after nearly 1000 iterations.
